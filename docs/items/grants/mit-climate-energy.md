MIT CEP Competition
The MIT Climate & Energy Prize competition seeks to move the world closer to net zero carbon emissions by empowering ambitious entrepreneurs to solve the world’s most difficult climate-related challenges.

We are the largest and longest-running competition for student-led climate & energy startups in the world. Since its founding in 2007, the MIT Climate & Energy Prize has received more than 1000 applications, offered world-class mentoring to over 315 teams, and granted more than $3.4M in non-dilutive cash prizes. Teams compete for $100,000+ in prize money and have access to mentoring and other resources. Since 2008, CEP alumni have raised over $4.6 billion in capital invested (as defined by PitchBook based on 170 companies identified to date).
