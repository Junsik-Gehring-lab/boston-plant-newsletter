The Winter Solstice edition of The New England Agroforester is coming out in mid-December, so here's your prompt/reminder to subscribe! 
This quarterly newsletter is brought to you by the ADAPT Project. Based at University of New Hampshire, ADAPT research explores agroforestry's potential as a sustainable strategy for expanding agricultural production in New England while promoting important forest-based goods and services such as climate adaptation and resilience. Integrating research, extension, and education, The New England Agroforester is part of ADAPT's efforts to engage and inspire farmers, landowners, natural resource managers, policy makers, students, and the general public.
