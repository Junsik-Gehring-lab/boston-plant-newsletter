**Tags:** organizations, internship, nasa

[NASA's Student Airborne Research Program (SARP)](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/early-career-opportunities/student-airborne-research-program/) is looking for motivated graduate students who are interested in mentoring, cultivating community, and who have strong knowledge in either scientific coding, atmospheric science, ocean remote sensing, or terrestrial ecology/remote sensing. SARP mentors play a key role in guiding students through their research project, with the support of a faculty advisor, and live on campus with the cohort, serving as resident advisors during the program.

The application and descriptions can be found at the link above. Application responses are preferred by February 8, 2026.  We would love for you to share this opportunity with your graduate students.
